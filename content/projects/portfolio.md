This is my portfolio site that is built using NextJS, React and hosted on Vercel.

You may find the code, how I modularized the components and how I structured the code base here on [GitHub](https://github.com/athkdev/me).

The objective of this site is generally for showcasing my projects, blogs and things that I find very interesting.
