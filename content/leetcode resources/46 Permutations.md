This is a very (very) crucial problem because if forms the base of many other problems. It uses the fundamental algorithm pattern called **backtracking**. Don’t let the name scare you, if you have solved any easy tree problems chances are pretty good that you’ve already used a backtracking algorithm. Yes, the DFS! Depth First Search is a backtracking algorithm as by definition it brute-forces through all possible outcomes.

The above problem, provides us an `int` array and asks us to generate all possible permutations of it. It is important to understand the key difference between _permutations and combinations_ though. While very similar, the major difference between the two is the ordering of characters in each of them. For eg. a permutation is an **ordered** set, while a combination is an **unordered** set. So, the string `"abc"` is different than `"bac"` in a permutation while in a combination they are the same thing.

For conceptual understanding, take a look at the recursive tree below. Each node represents a recursive function call, the yellow letters denote the options available at that call. Suppose our input is `str = "abc"`. As any recursive function requires a base case, the base case here is satisfied whenever the current permutation (that we are building in each function call) reaches the length of the input.

As you might have noticed by now, the algorithm needs to you make choices and then undo those choices when required. Below if a _pseudocode_ of a backtracking algorithm:

```jsx
function backtrack(arr, s):
	if basecase is satisfied:
		// depends on what you want to do, maybe you want to add the subresult to the result
		return

	for choice in choices:
		if choice is valid:
			make choice
			backtrack(arr, s)
			undo choice
```

We have worked with `strings` in the above example, but the are no different than working with arrays.

# Code:

### C++

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void generate(vector<vector<int>>& res, vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& current, vector<bool>& used) {
        if (current.size() == nums.size()) {    /// base case
            res.push_back(current);
            return;
        }

        for (int i=0;i<nums.size();i++) {
            if (!used[i]) {  // checking if choice is valid

								// making choices
								used[i] = true;
                current.push_back(nums[i]);

                generate(res, nums, current, used);

								// undoing choices
                used[i] = false;
                current.pop_back();
            }
        }
    }

    void populate_by_false(vector<bool>& used, int times) {
        for (int i=0;i<times;++i) {
            used.push_back(false);
        }
    }

    vector<vector<int>> permute(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        vector<int> current;
        vector<bool> used;

        populate_by_false(used, nums.size());

        generate(result, nums, current, used);

        return result;
    }
};
```

We are using `vector<bool> used` which is same size of input (`vector<int> nums`). This is so that we remember if any element is a valid option to use or not (see the yellow character in the string example above).

### Big O Analysis

The time complexity here is `O(N!)` as it would search for all possible outcomes, and the time increases exponentially with respect to the input size.

The space complexity is `O(N!)` as well, the result vector will contain N! strings/arrays for all input strings/arrays N, where `len(N) > 1`.
