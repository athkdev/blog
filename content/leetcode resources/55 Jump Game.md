Here we think creatively, one thing is for sure there’s a linear relationship between all the elements. Meaning, there’s a continuity between one index and another element. If the continuity is absent (any element is 0), we can return False.

So we start at the last index and consider it as a goal. As mentioned in the prompt, we can take at most `nums[i]` steps from `i` towards the goal. Similarly, if we iterate back, as long as any element is not zero,

# Code:

### Python (greedy solution)

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        goal = len(nums)-1

        for i in range(len(nums)-1,-1,-1):
            if i + nums[i] >= goal:
                goal = i


        return True if goal==0 else False
```

### Python (car-gas analogy)

```python

    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        '''
        car gas analogy

        image the array to be a road, and car is travelling on it.
        the car loses gas every element, and if it reaches zero - return false.
        but every element also gives us some amount of gas which we can pick up.
        if any element does not contribute to our gas storage and gas reaches
        zero - return false. if we are able to reach the end of the road (array) - return true.
        '''

        gas = 0

        for n in nums:
            if gas < 0:
                return False
            elif n > gas:
                gas = n

            gas -= 1

        return True

```

### Big O Analysis

- Runtime
  The runtime complexity here is `O(N)` as since we would be iterating the array once.
- Memory
  The memory usage is `O(1)`
