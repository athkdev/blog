USE A MAX HEAP. Since Python doesn't support max heaps fully (they do have a few private methods for max heaps, they are very unstable and are recommended not to use - it's not even in their documentation). So I used Java `PriorityQueue<Integer>`

Add all elements to the queue, and they will be sorted in a ascending manner. Then `maxHeap.poll()` the first two elements, check the conditions and `maxHeap.offer()` them to the queue.

Do this until `maxHeap.size() > 1`

# Code:

Java

```cpp
class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
       PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a,b) -> Integer.compare(b,a));

        for (int stone: stones) {
            maxHeap.offer(stone);
        }

        while (maxHeap.size() > 1) {
            int stone_1 = maxHeap.poll();
            int stone_2 = maxHeap.poll();

            maxHeap.offer(Math.abs(stone_1 - stone_2));
        }

        return maxHeap.poll();

    }
}
```
