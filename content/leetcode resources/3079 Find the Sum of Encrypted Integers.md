title: 3079 Find the Sum of Encrypted Integers

Fairly straightforward, the problem wants us to find the sum of the array elements but before calculating, the elements must be “encrypted.” As per their definition, a number is encrypted if all the digits in the number are replaced by the maximum digit in that number.

# Code:

### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def sumOfEncryptedInt(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ret = 0

        for n in nums:
            ret += int(max(str(n)) * len(str(n)))

        return ret
```

### Big O Analysis

- Runtime
  The runtime complexity here is `O(N * M)` where N = length of list `nums` and M = length of number `nums[i]`.
- Memory
  Constant space! Since we don’t use any extra data structure.
